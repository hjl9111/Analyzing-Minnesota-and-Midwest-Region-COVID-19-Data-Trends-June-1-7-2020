**Topic: Minnesota and Midwest Region COVID-19 Comparative Analysis**

**Language: SAS**

## Objective 

To conduct a comparative analysis to understand COVID-19 trends, compare outcomes with regional averages, pinpoint disparities, identify potential areas for intervention or support, and make recommendations for policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public to make informed decisions and allocate resources appropriately.

## Background

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that caused a global pandemic in December 2019 and lasted for several years. 

This analysis focuses on COVID-19 data in the state of Minnesota and consists of datasets on the daily COVID-19 information for the study period from June 1 to June 7, 2020 (“cd0601” – “cd0607”) and the day prior to the start of the study period (“cd0531”), both provided by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, along with a dataset provided by the U.S. Census indicating region for each U.S. state/territory.

## Discussion

Based on the analysis of the COVID-19 data from Minnesota compared to the regional Midwest averages and the observed trends in new confirmed cases, we would recommend increasing testing capacity such as expanding testing centers in Minnesota to help in early detection and isolation of cases to reduce the spread of the virus since both number of tests and confirmed cases at the state-level are lower compared to regional averages. 

In addition, we should provide targeted public health interventions directed towards high-risk groups such as the elderly or those with pre-existing conditions as well as immediately and appropriately allocate hospital resources (e.g., beds, medical staff, etc.) for high number of cases and high-risk areas in Minnesota. 

Furthermore, corresponding policies should be adaptable based on the latest data, including readiness to implement or ease restrictions based on the number of cases, hospitalization rates, etc. along with developing a long-term plan which should include guidelines for potential future outbreaks given the unpredictability of COVID-19.
